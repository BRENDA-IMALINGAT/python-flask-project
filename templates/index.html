          <h3>HTML5 Markup</h3>
          <p>
            Divine Code Software uses HTML5 as their primary markup language for building robust, responsive, and accessible web applications. This choice is based on future-proofing, improved user experience, accessibility, simplified development, and enhanced SEO. HTML5 ensures compatibility with evolving browser technologies and devices, allowing for engaging, interactive, and responsive interfaces that adapt to various screen sizes and devices. Its semantic structure and ARIA attributes enable inclusive web applications catering to diverse user needs. The intuitive syntax of HTML5 reduces development time and effort, while its semantic markup and microdata support enhance web applications' visibility and ranking in search engine results.
